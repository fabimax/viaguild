ViaGuild

This project is about building a web app called ViaGuild (VG). At its core, VG would:
* enable users of Bluesky, Twitter, Twitch to create and join Guilds, with different roles
* have an API that lets external apps 1) read Guild membership of a given social user, 2) assign Badges to a given VG Guild or VG user of their choice

Guilds, memberships, and badges should also appear and be manageable on viaguild.com

ViaGuild

This project is about building a web app called ViaGuild (VG). At its core, VG would:
1. enable users of Bluesky, Twitter, Twitch, Discord to create and join Guilds, with different roles
2. have an API that lets external apps 1) read Guild membership of a given social user, 2) assign Badges to a given VG Guild or VG user of their choice

Guilds, memberships, and badges should also appear and be manageable on viaguild.com

Point 2 is meant to also enable third parties to create activities for guilds (or users) to participate in, whether competitive or not.

Competitive example 1: VG users log in on a third party's game through Twitter. The third party can search programmatically on VG which Guild those Twitter users belong to. The winning Guilds are programmatically rewarded with a badge.
Non-competitive activity example 1: the activity is a personality test. Guilds receive different badges depending on the average personality of their members that took the test.

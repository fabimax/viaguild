# Phase 2 Implementation Plan: Guild Management

## Step 1: Core Guild Management Overview

**Backend:**
- ✅ Create basic guild profile endpoint that returns essential guild data (name, description, avatar, member count)
- ✅ Implement simplified member listing endpoint with pagination (first focus on returning just member IDs, usernames, roles)
- ✅ Add endpoint for checking user permissions within a guild

**Frontend:**
- Build the guild management layout shell with navigation sidebar from mockup
- Implement basic guild profile card with guild details
- Create a simplified member list component that shows usernames and roles

**Integration:**
- Connect the guild profile card to the real API
- Use mock data for other components initially
- Implement permission-based conditional rendering of admin actions

**Deliverable:** A functioning guild overview page with real guild data and basic member information.

## Step 2: Member Management Core

**Backend:**
- Extend member listing endpoint with detailed user information
- Add endpoints for role management (promote/demote members)
- Implement member removal endpoint

**Frontend:**
- Enhance member list with avatars and more detailed information
- Add role management UI controls (dropdown for role selection)
- Implement member removal confirmation modal

**Integration:**
- Replace mock member data with live API data
- Connect role management UI to backend endpoints
- Add proper error handling for permission issues

**Deliverable:** Functional member management within the guild interface.

## Step 3: Guild Settings and Customization

**Backend:**
- Create endpoints for updating guild profile information
- Implement guild join settings (open/invitation-only) endpoint
- Add guild avatar upload and management functionality

**Frontend:**
- Build guild settings form component
- Create avatar upload and cropping interface
- Implement join settings toggle (whether anyone can join or invitation required)

**Integration:**
- Connect settings form to update endpoints
- Implement real-time validation
- Add success/failure notifications

**Deliverable:** Complete guild profile management capabilities.

## Step 4: Guild Search and Discovery

**Backend:**
- Implement guild search endpoint with filtering options
- Create guild discovery endpoint that suggests relevant guilds
- Add endpoints for tracking guild relationships

**Frontend:**
- Build search interface with filters
- Create discovery component with guild cards
- Implement guild relationship visualization

**Integration:**
- Connect search UI to backend with proper caching
- Implement pagination for search results
- Add analytics tracking for guild discovery

**Deliverable:** Guild search and discovery functionality for users to find and join new guilds.

## Step 5: Guild Profile Public View

**Backend:**
- Create public-facing guild profile endpoint with appropriate visibility controls
- Implement guild statistics endpoint for public display
- Add endpoint for requesting to join a guild

**Frontend:**
- Build public guild profile page
- Create "request to join" UI component for invitation-only guilds
- Implement direct "join" button for open guilds
- Implement guild statistics visualization

**Integration:**
- Apply join requirements consistently between frontend and backend
- Add proper authorization checks
- Implement join request flow

**Deliverable:** Complete public guild profile with appropriate join functionality based on guild settings.

## Step 6: Polish and Responsive Design

**Backend:**
- Optimize all endpoints for performance
- Add caching where appropriate
- Implement any missing edge cases

**Frontend:**
- Ensure responsive design works across all screen sizes
- Implement loading states and skeleton screens
- Add animations and transitions for better UX

**Integration:**
- Comprehensive end-to-end testing
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility review

**Deliverable:** Fully polished guild management system ready for production.

## Development and Testing Strategy

For each increment:

1. **Start with API contracts:**
   - Define the exact request/response format for new endpoints
   - Create mock implementations for frontend development

2. **Build in parallel:**
   - Backend team implements real endpoints
   - Frontend team builds UI with mock data

3. **Integration checkpoint:**
   - Merge frontend and backend work
   - Test with real data
   - Address any integration issues

4. **User testing:**
   - Get feedback on the increment
   - Make necessary adjustments before moving to next increment

5. **Test coverage:**
   - Unit tests for all new components and endpoints
   - Integration tests for critical workflows
   - End-to-end tests for core user journeys

This approach allows you to have a working product at each step while incrementally adding more functionality, with regular integration points to catch problems early.

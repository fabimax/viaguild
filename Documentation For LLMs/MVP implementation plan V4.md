 # ViaGuild MVP Implementation Plan V4

## Overview
This document outlines the revised implementation plan for the ViaGuild Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Building on the foundation of existing functionality (user registration, authentication, social account linking, and user search), this plan takes an iterative, test-driven approach with parallel frontend and backend development to deliver user value sooner.
Completed items of the plan have been and will be marked with: ✅

## Key Implementation Principles

1. **Parallel Frontend/Backend Development**
   - Start frontend development with mock data early
   - Define API contracts before implementation
   - Enable simultaneous work streams

2. **Iterative Value Delivery**
   - Prioritize user-visible features first
   - Release simpler but complete versions for early feedback
   - Implement core workflows before expanding to advanced features

3. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests before implementing features
   - Create smaller, more testable units of work
   - Implement comprehensive test coverage across all layers

4. **User Feedback Integration**
   - Add analytics from the beginning
   - Implement feedback mechanisms in early versions
   - Plan for rapid iterations based on user input

## Existing Foundation (Already Implemented)
- ✅ User registration and authentication
- ✅ Social account linking (Twitter, Bluesky, Twitch, Discord)
- ✅ User profiles with avatars and privacy settings
- ✅ User search across platforms

## Seed Script Strategy

A comprehensive seed data strategy is crucial for efficient development and testing. The plan includes:

1. **Tiered Seed Approach**
   - `dev` seeds: Extensive test data for all features
   - `demo` seeds: High-quality showcase examples
   - `test` seeds: Minimal data for automated testing

2. **Seed Script Implementation**
   ```typescript
   // prisma/seed.ts structure
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
   import { seedUsers } from './seeds/users'
   import { seedGuilds } from './seeds/guilds'
   // Additional imports

   const prisma = new PrismaClient()

   async function main() {
     // Order matters for relationships
     await seedUsers(prisma)
     await seedGuilds(prisma)
     // Additional seeding
   }

   main()
     .then(async () => await prisma.$disconnect())
     .catch(async (e) => {
       console.error(e)
       await prisma.$disconnect()
       process.exit(1)
     })
   ```

3. **Key Data Categories to Seed**
   - Users with various social account links
   - Guilds with different settings and membership configurations
   - Role assignments across guilds
   - Default badge templates and shapes
   - Badge allocations and distributions
   - Invitation examples in different states

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Development: Local environments with seeded data
   - Staging: Production-like environment for testing
   - Production: Live environment with migration strategy

2. **Continuous Integration/Deployment**
   - Implement GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
   - Automate testing for all pull requests
   - Configure deployment process for each environment

3. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Set up error tracking with Sentry
   - Implement user analytics with a privacy-focused solution
   - Create performance monitoring for API endpoints

## Risk Management

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Badge system complexity: Mitigate by implementing in phases
   - API performance: Address through load testing and optimization
   - Data consistency: Ensure through transaction management

2. **User Experience Risks**
   - Invitation flow complexity: Validate with user testing
   - Badge system clarity: Implement clear UI and tooltips
   - Guild management learning curve: Create onboarding guidance

## Post-MVP Considerations
1. **Feature Expansion**
   - Advanced guild relationships
   - Enhanced badge customization
   - Additional social platform integrations
2. **Scaling Preparation**
   - Database indexing strategy
   - Caching implementation plan
   - API performance optimization

3. **User Growth**
   - Community engagement features
   - Retention mechanics
   - Viral invitation optimizations

This implementation plan provides a balanced approach to delivering the ViaGuild MVP with a focus on quality, user value, and maintainable development practices.

17. **API Documentation**
    - Document endpoint usage

## Implementation Notes

### Key Decision: Invites Before Badges
We've prioritized the invite system before badges because:
1. Invites are essential for guild growth and community building
2. Guilds need members before badges become meaningful
3. The invite system directly supports the social networking aspect of ViaGuild
4. Badges are an enhancement feature rather than core functionality

### Development Approach
For each implementation step:
1. Implement one model/feature at a time
2. Write unit tests for each service
3. Test API endpoints independently
4. Build UI components that can work in isolation
5. Integrate components only after individual testing

This incremental approach ensures we can verify each component works before building upon it, reducing the risk of accumulated bugs and making debugging easier.
